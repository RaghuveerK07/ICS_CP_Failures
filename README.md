"STUDENT ATTENDANCE SYSTEM"
The provided code constitutes a Student Attendance Management System with a command-line interface. Upon execution, the program prompts the user to input a file name, creating a CSV file in the system. Subsequently, the user is presented with a menu, offering operations such as inputting attendance, checking attendance and exiting the program.

The "Input Attendance" operation enables the user to input attendance details, including the date, student roll number, and name. The information is appended to the existing CSV file.

The "Check Attendance" operation prompts the user to input a file name and then requests the roll number and date for which attendance needs to be checked. The system reads through the file, determines the presence or absence of the specified student on the given date, and provides feedback accordingly.

The program operates within a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple operations sequentially. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit the program.
